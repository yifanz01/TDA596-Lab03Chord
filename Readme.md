##Chord Algorithm

Chord is a distributed lookup protocol designed for peer-to-peer (P2P) systems. It efficiently locates the node responsible for storing a particular data item, even as nodes dynamically join or leave the network. Each node and data item is assigned a unique identifier via consistent hashing, placing them into a logical ring structure.

#Key Features:

Consistent Hashing: Ensures minimal data movement when nodes join or leave.

Distributed Lookup: Provides fast and efficient queries, typically resolving requests in O(log N) time.

Fault Tolerance: Gracefully handles node failures and dynamically maintains routing information.

#How it Works:

Each node maintains a "finger table" containing references to other nodes in the network, enabling fast lookups.

Data items are mapped to nodes by hashing their keys. The node succeeding the key's hash value is responsible for storing the data.

Lookups traverse the network using the finger table pointers, significantly speeding up search compared to linear traversal.

Chord's structured approach makes it widely used in scalable distributed storage systems and decentralized applications.
