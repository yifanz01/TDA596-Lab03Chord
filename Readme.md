# Chord Algorithm Implementation

Chord is a distributed lookup protocol designed for peer-to-peer (P2P) systems. It efficiently locates the node responsible for storing a particular data item, even as nodes dynamically join or leave the network. Each node and data item is assigned a unique identifier via consistent hashing, placing them into a logical ring structure.

## Key Features
- **Consistent Hashing**: Ensures minimal data movement when nodes join or leave.
- **Distributed Lookup**: Provides fast and efficient queries, typically resolving requests in **O(log N)** time.
- **Fault Tolerance**: Gracefully handles node failures and dynamically maintains routing information.

## How it Works
- Each node maintains a **finger table** containing references to other nodes in the network, enabling fast lookups.
- Data items are mapped to nodes by hashing their keys. The node succeeding the key's hash value is responsible for storing the data.
- Lookups traverse the network using finger table pointers, significantly speeding up search compared to linear traversal.

## Applications
Chord's structured approach makes it suitable for various applications, including:
- Scalable distributed storage systems
- Decentralized applications
- Efficient distributed databases
- Peer-to-peer networks requiring reliable and fast data retrieval
